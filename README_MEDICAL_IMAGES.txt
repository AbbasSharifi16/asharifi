# Medical Image Processing - Required Images

This directory should contain the following image files for the Medical Image Processing research page:

## Required Files:

1. **gasteric_cancer.png** - Gastric cancer analysis visualization using Gene Expression Programming
2. **gene.png** - Gene expression programming framework diagram
3. **segmentation.jpg** - Medical image segmentation results showing tumor detection
4. **unet.jpg** - U-Net vs SAM model comparison for breast tumor detection

## Image Placement:

All images should be placed in: `public/img/`

## Purpose:
