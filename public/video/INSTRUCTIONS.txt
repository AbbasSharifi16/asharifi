VIDEO FILES NEEDED FOR RESEARCH PAGE
======================================

The research page is configured to display the following videos with autoplay:

MAIN EXPERIMENTAL SETUP VIDEO:
- File name: geyser_experimental_setup.mp4
- Location: Place in this directory (public/video/)
- Purpose: Background video with transparent overlay showing project overview
- Recommended size: 1920x1080, under 50MB
- Will autoplay on page load

GEYSER EXPERIMENT VIDEOS (3 videos):
1. geyser_video1.mp4 (or geyser_video1.mov)
   - Cyclic Geyser Eruption - Test 1
   
2. geyser_video2.mp4
   - Violent Geyser Eruption - Test 2
   
3. geyser_video3.mp4
   - High-Speed Capture - Test 3

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
✓ Video containers created and styled
✓ Autoplay configured with proper attributes
✓ Fallback to lab_image.jpg if videos not found
✓ Content Security Policy updated to allow video playback
✓ JavaScript handlers for autoplay and error handling added

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:
=================
- Until you add the video files, the lab_image.jpg will show as fallback
- Once you add the videos, they will automatically play
- Videos are set to: autoplay, loop, muted, playsinline
- If autoplay is blocked by browser, videos will show with controls

TO ADD VIDEOS:
==============
1. Copy your 4 video files to this directory
2. Make sure file names match exactly:
   - geyser_experimental_setup.mp4
   - geyser_video1.mp4 (or .mov)
   - geyser_video2.mp4
   - geyser_video3.mp4
3. Refresh the research page - videos will play automatically!

NOTE: The server needs to be restarted after adding video files for the first time.
Use: npm start (or just refresh if using nodemon)
